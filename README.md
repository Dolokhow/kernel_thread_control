# kernel_thread_control
Kernel subsystem for thread management

Project focused on creating a system that implements threads, semaphores and events. 
Threads were realized with concepts of context switching, synchronous and asynchronous preemption and time sharing. 
Events were used to model occasional processes i.e. processes that react on external input. 
Both thread synchronization and events were implemented using semaphores.
